# its not my readme file that's already created.
I just wanted to say that if you're a fan of avatar
(the cartoon not the blue people movie)
(the blue people movie is cool too tho)
you should check out the Dragon Prince
its on netflix
its made by Aaron Ehazs, the head writer of Avatar
and some of Avatars producers or somethin
but anyway its really good and has
surprisingly good worldbuilding
it does have some "we can win with the power of FRIENDSHIP"
type moments in there, and the animation style is admittedly
a little wack
but I think its super cool
So watch it.
